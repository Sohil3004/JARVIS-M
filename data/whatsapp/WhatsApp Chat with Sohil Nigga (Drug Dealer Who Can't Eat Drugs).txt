26/09/24, 18:55 - Sumit Nair: like you have a page stored on a server
26/09/24, 18:55 - Sumit Nair: you ask the server to give it to you
26/09/24, 18:56 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Okay so it just fetches?
26/09/24, 18:56 - Sumit Nair: and the server will decide if it should or shouldn't give it to you
26/09/24, 18:56 - Sumit Nair: or you make a google form
26/09/24, 18:56 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): How does it decide?
26/09/24, 18:57 - Sumit Nair: you want to save the data you send the form data to the server and it will process it like adding it to a db
26/09/24, 18:57 - Sumit Nair: you have to program it
26/09/24, 18:57 - Sumit Nair: its your choice
26/09/24, 18:57 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): 👍👍
26/09/24, 18:57 - Sumit Nair: your basically coding the server to react to the way people will use it
26/09/24, 18:57 - Sumit Nair: thats ajax
26/09/24, 18:58 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Alrighttt
Now react
26/09/24, 18:58 - Sumit Nair: react is basically just a library used in web dev to speed up frontend development
26/09/24, 18:58 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Ajax uses Js only or does it have any other lang?
26/09/24, 18:59 - Sumit Nair: they have all the components made with pre defined behaviour
26/09/24, 18:59 - Sumit Nair: its expansion is async js and xml
26/09/24, 18:59 - Sumit Nair: you have to load them using js
26/09/24, 18:59 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Ahh then whats the difference between that and jquery?
26/09/24, 19:00 - Sumit Nair: jquery cant create html content
26/09/24, 19:00 - Sumit Nair: it just makes selecting elements easier
26/09/24, 19:00 - Sumit Nair: react will create the html element
26/09/24, 19:00 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): It can use append() or something to create no?
26/09/24, 19:01 - Sumit Nair: yea you can
26/09/24, 19:01 - Sumit Nair: but thats for 1 element
26/09/24, 19:01 - Sumit Nair: imagine in youtube
26/09/24, 19:01 - Sumit Nair: they got thousands of youtube videos
26/09/24, 19:02 - Sumit Nair: they have to create elements with buttons and images
26/09/24, 19:02 - Sumit Nair: soo we can use react there as it helps us do it faster
26/09/24, 19:02 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Ahh
26/09/24, 19:03 - Sumit Nair: whatever you do in react can be done in css and html and js
26/09/24, 19:03 - Sumit Nair: its just that if it takes you 10 mins in html css and js
26/09/24, 19:03 - Sumit Nair: it takes like 30 seconds in react
26/09/24, 19:03 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Okay so far how much of react is there in unit 2?
26/09/24, 19:03 - Sumit Nair: also we dont need to go select class in react we can use js directly on it
26/09/24, 19:04 - Sumit Nair: just introduction of components
26/09/24, 19:04 - Sumit Nair: and what react is
26/09/24, 19:04 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): How many components?
26/09/24, 19:05 - Sumit Nair: in class she just taught us how to create h1 and all idk how many exactly are there
26/09/24, 19:05 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Alright so there isnt much then
26/09/24, 19:05 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Thats what im assuming
26/09/24, 19:06 - Sumit Nair: unit 3 is basically react
26/09/24, 19:06 - Sumit Nair: only intro is in unit 2
26/09/24, 19:06 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): 👍
26/09/24, 19:06 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): I'm still in unit 1 anyways
26/09/24, 19:07 - Sumit Nair: they basically taught till how we can use inline css in react
26/09/24, 19:08 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Okay so internal and external version is in unit 3 then?
26/09/24, 19:08 - Sumit Nair: <Media omitted>
26/09/24, 19:08 - Sumit Nair: its not exactly like that
26/09/24, 19:09 - Sumit Nair: you just need to remember the extends react.component
26/09/24, 19:09 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Are there a lot?
26/09/24, 19:10 - Sumit Nair: class name extends react.components
26/09/24, 19:10 - Sumit Nair: thats all
26/09/24, 19:10 - Sumit Nair: for exam no
26/09/24, 19:10 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Alright

26/09/24, 19:11 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Does slides have everything??
26/09/24, 19:11 - Sumit Nair: and put your html in the { } brackets
26/09/24, 19:11 - Sumit Nair: yea
26/09/24, 19:13 - Sumit Nair: soo basically,
class Element extends React.Componet {
  render(){
  }
}
26/09/24, 19:13 - Sumit Nair: thats all in react
26/09/24, 19:13 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Okayy and unit 2 is all abt css
26/09/24, 19:13 - Sumit Nair: unit 1 is about css
26/09/24, 19:14 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): No no the react part of unit 2

Nothing else
12/11/24, 22:43 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Dont
12/11/24, 22:44 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): I'll make a grp now wait
12/11/24, 22:44 - Sumit Nair: Okok make
13/11/24, 09:45 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Yes, the output shown here aligns with the expected behavior of the shift_register module based on the testbench provided. Let's go over the output line-by-line to confirm:

Reset Phase:

Time = 0: Parallel Out is xxxx, and Serial Out is x. This indicates that the register is in an unknown state (undefined) at the very start.
Time = 5: After the initial clock pulse with rst = 1, Parallel Out becomes 0000, and Serial Out is 0. The reset has cleared the shift register, setting all bits to 0.
Shift-in Sequence 1011:

Time = 15: Serial In is 1, and this value starts shifting into the register.
Time = 25: Parallel Out becomes 0001, reflecting the shifted-in bit. Serial Out remains 0.
Time = 35: Serial In is 0. After this clock cycle, Parallel Out updates to 0010.
Time = 45: Serial In is 1, shifting in another 1.
Time = 55: Parallel Out becomes 1011, with Serial Out now showing 1, as the MSB has a 1.
Holding State:

Time = 65: Serial In continues as 1, which leads to further shifting in the register.
The shift register now holds 0111 in Parallel Out.
Time = 75: Serial In is 1, which fills the register to 1111.
Reset Again:

Time = 85: rst is applied again, which clears Parallel Out to 0000 and Serial Out to 0.
End of Simulation:

The $finish command is called at time = 100, ending the simulation.
Summary
The output log reflects the expected values of Parallel Out and Serial Out based on the shift sequence 1011, followed by a reset. This output confirms that the shift register and testbench are functioning correctly.

08/02/25, 20:18 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): nlightnment?
08/02/25, 20:18 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): whats the amazing idea?
08/02/25, 20:18 - Sumit Nair: kinda hear me out
08/02/25, 20:18 - Sumit Nair: see niggas will take photos but never share them properly
08/02/25, 20:18 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): yes
08/02/25, 20:18 - Sumit Nair: i should sit and ask them for photos every 5 mins
08/02/25, 20:18 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): pretty much
08/02/25, 20:19 - Sumit Nair: then some nigga will make gdrive and send then everyone will upload after a week
08/02/25, 20:19 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): yup yup
08/02/25, 20:19 - Sumit Nair: this is what happens 100% of the time
08/02/25, 20:19 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): yes
08/02/25, 20:19 - Sumit Nair: either they do that or put in wp
08/02/25, 20:19 - Sumit Nair: too make this shit simpler put one app select the people in that event
08/02/25, 20:19 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): wp?
08/02/25, 20:19 - Sumit Nair: whatsaap
08/02/25, 20:20 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): ahh
08/02/25, 20:20 - Sumit Nair: the min you take photo it goes into a drive we create
08/02/25, 20:20 - Sumit Nair: soo anyone who takes pics for that event will auto upload it into a drive
08/02/25, 20:20 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): i think there is something like that
cause I remember my sister using it for a while until it became paid or something
08/02/25, 20:20 - Sumit Nair: and it'll be organised also
08/02/25, 20:21 - Sumit Nair: whaaa
08/02/25, 20:21 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): yea our family goa trip we did she put all of us into a group and told us to take pics and well auto get others as well
08/02/25, 20:22 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): but it wasn't organized and had a limit to how many photos can be taken by each person of the grp
08/02/25, 20:22 - Sumit Nair: for this i thought we can put pricing plans similar to that off gdrive
08/02/25, 20:23 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): its a very good idea
08/02/25, 20:23 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): but starting it off with gdrive paid plan will be too much
08/02/25, 20:23 - Sumit Nair: no number of pic limit just amount of storage limit
08/02/25, 20:23 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): how about we give then some sale or something
08/02/25, 20:24 - Sumit Nair: or like we can integrate it with gdrive only
08/02/25, 20:24 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): like?
08/02/25, 20:24 - Sumit Nair: we use their gdrive to store pics
08/02/25, 20:24 - Sumit Nair: just shared properly
08/02/25, 20:24 - Sumit Nair: using encryption
08/02/25, 20:24 - Sumit Nair: or this only we can do
08/02/25, 20:25 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): yea yea but how do we do it really
08/02/25, 20:25 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): cause I can see wonders with this idea
08/02/25, 20:25 - Sumit Nair: this seems like legal issues
08/02/25, 20:26 - Sumit Nair: but see my friend cooked an app that uses old laptops as servers
08/02/25, 20:26 - Sumit Nair: soo that was the idea
08/02/25, 20:26 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): it sounds like those sketchy websites which ask u to give them permission to their photos etc only until we are official that's how everyone might respond
08/02/25, 20:27 - Sumit Nair: mostly we need to make an app for it using flutter
08/02/25, 20:27 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): ohhh
08/02/25, 20:27 - Sumit Nair: yea
08/02/25, 20:27 - Sumit Nair: soo thats why this seems like a more possible situation
08/02/25, 20:28 - Sumit Nair: its high potential in my opinion
08/02/25, 20:28 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): ok so how do we start with it?
08/02/25, 20:28 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): very high
08/02/25, 20:28 - Sumit Nair: we need a team
08/02/25, 20:29 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): the amt of ppl who travel and that too in grps are a lot 
it can be used as a safe backup by solo travellers as well
08/02/25, 20:29 - Sumit Nair: we need to decide the tech stack, the branding part
08/02/25, 20:29 - Sumit Nair: ooooo

21/02/25, 19:38 - Sumit Nair: bro dont bother about this for now but idt ill get this idea again for the photo sharing  thing we can do peer to peer transfer so we dont need to do any server and all just direct transfer without quality compromise and it uses their phone storage only so they wont cry about it
21/02/25, 19:39 - Sumit Nair: works with no internet too
21/02/25, 19:47 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Nigga go study
21/02/25, 19:47 - Sumit Nair: i am studying cie
21/02/25, 19:48 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Ur ideas are only poppin when u gotta study
21/02/25, 19:48 - Sumit Nair: exactly
21/02/25, 19:48 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): That means under pressure u get ideas
21/02/25, 19:48 - Sumit Nair: now thats interesting
21/02/25, 19:48 - Sumit Nair: ok bye me go study i wont bother you either
21/02/25, 19:49 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): I'm not studying either
21/02/25, 19:49 - Sumit Nair: ok then get back to this
21/02/25, 19:49 - Sumit Nair: bro youve seen nearby share no
21/02/25, 19:49 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Huh
21/02/25, 19:49 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Wdym nearby share?
21/02/25, 19:50 - Sumit Nair: when you click share you see an option called nearby share
21/02/25, 19:50 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Never paid attention to it
21/02/25, 19:50 - Sumit Nair: its supposed to be like apples air drop
21/02/25, 19:51 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Ohh
21/02/25, 19:51 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Thats pretty good feature then
21/02/25, 19:51 - Sumit Nair: Samsung you have quick share too
21/02/25, 19:51 - Sumit Nair: but problem is its ass and nobody uses it
21/02/25, 19:52 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): So ur idea is to develop that?
21/02/25, 19:52 - Sumit Nair: see the problem is everything is limited to individual os
21/02/25, 19:53 - Sumit Nair: in windows also you have that same issue works with windows only
21/02/25, 19:53 - Sumit Nair: air drop with apple only
21/02/25, 19:53 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Yes
21/02/25, 19:53 - Sumit Nair: soo we need to make something that with help of our app works for all of them together
21/02/25, 19:54 - Sumit Nair: its like p2p
21/02/25, 19:54 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): That would be a hit 
If we could make it share files or something else including photos
21/02/25, 19:54 - Sumit Nair: server will maintain only ips
21/02/25, 19:54 - Sumit Nair: if it works it can share whatever the hell you want
21/02/25, 19:55 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Yea that would be too op for just sharing the photos
21/02/25, 19:55 - Sumit Nair: app will ask for recipient ip and then they share it directly no compression no need to store
21/02/25, 19:55 - Sumit Nair: send to other nigga easily
21/02/25, 19:55 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): How will ik the recipients ip?
21/02/25, 19:56 - Sumit Nair: our app will be on that phone also no
21/02/25, 19:56 - Sumit Nair: server will create one channel for these devices
21/02/25, 19:57 - Sumit Nair: if they are close enough maybe we can try to directly send it without server
21/02/25, 19:57 - Sumit Nair: like if they on same wifi
21/02/25, 19:57 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Yeye
21/02/25, 19:57 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Its basically like shareit
21/02/25, 19:57 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): If uk
21/02/25, 19:58 - Sumit Nair: kind of ig
21/02/25, 19:58 - Sumit Nair: but with end to end encryption and groups and stuff
21/02/25, 19:58 - Sumit Nair: if niggas choose we can store on server for that they have to pay
21/02/25, 19:58 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): That one we were able to send everything including games and files 
To other os ppl as well
Just that i dont think it was secure enough
21/02/25, 19:59 - Sumit Nair: people used to send apk files and all
21/02/25, 19:59 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Yeaaa
21/02/25, 19:59 - Sumit Nair: this is much more organised and secure
21/02/25, 20:00 - Sumit Nair: you can make friends list and all
21/02/25, 20:00 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Yea ig
21/02/25, 20:00 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): That we can add more features later on
21/02/25, 20:01 - Sumit Nair: yea we can make it of one messaging platform
21/02/25, 20:01 - Sumit Nair: see advantage is niggas will run out of storage sooner or later
21/02/25, 20:01 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): But that defeats the purpose of why we started it initally
21/02/25, 20:01 - Sumit Nair: then theyll use drive feature
21/02/25, 20:02 - Sumit Nair: maybe not our idea was transfering files
21/02/25, 20:02 - Sumit Nair: we just developing it
21/02/25, 20:03 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): More like transferring photos while they just took the pics
21/02/25, 20:03 - Sumit Nair: but yea best to leave it at photos only
21/02/25, 20:03 - Sumit Nair: this is like wayyy later if we are bored
21/02/25, 20:04 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): If they actually planned to transfer it then why would we even want to make this
21/02/25, 20:04 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): This is for those who just keep it in their phones once they took the pic cause they are lazy to actually send
21/02/25, 20:04 - Sumit Nair: nono see what i meant was the transferring protocol is like this
21/02/25, 20:05 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Yea this can be like diff versions of our app
21/02/25, 20:05 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Like excel
Word
Ppt and so on
21/02/25, 20:05 - Sumit Nair: the expansion capability is insane
21/02/25, 20:05 - Sumit Nair: yea
21/02/25, 20:05 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): First we'll introduce the photos only
21/02/25, 20:05 - Sumit Nair: yesyes
21/02/25, 20:06 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Then show them that we have more than that
And make it paid to use feature
21/02/25, 20:06 - Sumit Nair: exactly
21/02/25, 20:06 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Something along those lines
21/02/25, 20:06 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): But the p2p idea is good
Its better as well
21/02/25, 20:07 - Sumit Nair: currently in gallery if you see organisation is soo ass
21/02/25, 20:07 - Sumit Nair: we can promote organisation
21/02/25, 20:07 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Wait u want to organize their existing gallery or the ones they share?
21/02/25, 20:07 - Sumit Nair: cause when these guys create an event to upload photos they automatically organising it
21/02/25, 20:08 - Sumit Nair: not their gallery hell nah
21/02/25, 20:08 - Sumit Nair: only what they share
21/02/25, 20:08 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Then alr
If not this would be breach of privacy
21/02/25, 20:08 - Sumit Nair: ;eave that our bot will get trauma if it goes through their gallery
21/02/25, 20:09 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Alr now I'll go study
21/02/25, 20:10 - Sumit Nair: yeye go study

26/09/25, 21:03 - Sumit Nair: I mean I want to learn course so
26/09/25, 21:03 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Great question 👍 You’re asking in the context of a Social Computing (SC) project – “which part of J.A.R.V.I.S. (Iron Man’s AI assistant) could realistically be built as a mid-complexity project within half a semester.”

Let’s break it down:


---

🔹 What J.A.R.V.I.S. is (in SC terms)

J.A.R.V.I.S. is a mix of:

Speech interface (NLP, voice commands)

Information retrieval (fetching updates, summarizing)

Social interaction (acting as a conversational agent)

Task delegation (managing tasks, reminders, control of devices)

Decision support (suggestions, recommendations)


A full J.A.R.V.I.S. is sci-fi, but for a Social Computing project, you only need to implement one or two realistic modules that align with SC concepts like interaction, collaboration, recommendation, sentiment analysis, or collective intelligence.


---

🔹 J.A.R.V.I.S. Features You Could Build (Mid Complexity, Half-Semester)

1. Personalized News & Sentiment Analyzer

What it does: Takes user’s voice/text input (“Give me today’s news on climate change”) → fetches news/Twitter posts → summarizes + shows sentiment (positive/negative).

SC connection: Uses crowdsourced data (social media) to provide insights.

Tools: Python (News API, Tweepy), VADER/TextBlob for sentiment, simple web/voice UI.



---

2. Smart Social Task Assistant

What it does: Lets a group of users add tasks/events → system organizes and suggests best times/priority → group can vote/like tasks.

SC connection: Collaborative task management (crowdsourcing).

Tools: Flask/Django + SQLite + simple voting mechanism.



---

3. Mini Social Recommender (“What should I watch/listen to?”)

What it does: Users ask J.A.R.V.I.S. for a recommendation → system aggregates preferences from peers (social filtering) → recommends movies, songs, or courses.

SC connection: Collective intelligence & recommendation systems.

Tools: Flask + collaborative filtering (Surprise library) + basic UI.



---

4. Social Media Summarizer

What it does: User says “J.A.R.V.I.S., summarize what people are saying about cricket today.” → System fetches trending tweets/posts → summarizes main points.

SC connection: Uses large-scale user-generated content and condenses it for personal use.

Tools: Twitter API, Hugging Face summarizer, dashboard UI.



---

5. Toxic Comment Moderator (Jarvis for Online Communities)

What it does: Works as a forum/chat moderator. J.A.R.V.I.S. flags toxic or off-topic comments and highlights useful ones.

SC connection: Community moderation & social interaction quality.

Tools: Perspective API / HuggingFace toxicity model + chat/forum backend.



---

🔹 Recommended Pick for You

Since you want a mid-level, doable SC project in half a semester → the most practical J.A.R.V.I.S.-like parts are:

✅ Social Media Summarizer (collect + analyze + present)
✅ Mini Social Recommender (recommendations using group preferences)
✅ Toxic Comment Moderator (AI-powered moderator for communities)

All 3 are socially-driven, computationally feasible, and aligned with SC.

👉 Do you want me to design a step-by-step project plan (modules, tools, deliverables, timeline) for one of these J.A.R.V.I.S.-like ideas so you can directly propose it as your project?

29/09/25, 11:37 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Mini Jarvis for Your Class/Team

What it does:

Acts as a group assistant:

Answers “What’s the deadline for CN project?” (fetches from shared Google Doc/Sheet)

“Who has uploaded their part?” (checks team progress)

“Summarize today’s group chat” (extracts key points from WhatsApp/Telegram group).



Feels Jarvis-like because: It’s a personal assistant for a team, not just an app.

Tools: Google Sheets API, Telegram bot, NLP summarization.
29/09/25, 11:37 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): This one i like
29/09/25, 11:37 - Sumit Nair: Done put

29/09/25, 12:07 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Structure for Your Initial Presentation (Jarvis-WhatsApp Project)
1. Title Slide

Title: “Jarvis: An NLP-based Assistant for WhatsApp Chat Summarization and Task Management”

Team Members: [Your Names]

Course: Social Computing

2. Introduction / Motivation

WhatsApp is the most widely used collaboration tool.

Problem: Long chats → information overload.

Users struggle to track decisions, deadlines, and contributions.

Industry baseline: WhatsApp just launched “message summaries” (2025) but only for private messages.

Gap: No effective team-oriented summarizer for group chats (with tasks/reminders).

👉 End with: “Our goal is to design a task-aware summarization assistant (‘Jarvis’) for WhatsApp groups.”

3. Base Paper (Literature Background)

Example base paper: Lu et al., 2025 — MRDS for Few-shot Dialogue Summarization

Uses LLMs to synthesize training data → improves summarization when data is scarce.

Other related works: Hierarchical attention (Yang et al., 2025), Graph-based task extraction, WhatsApp chat summarizer prototype (2025).

Gap identified: None of these focus on WhatsApp group-task awareness.

4. Problem Statement

“We aim to extend dialogue summarization techniques for WhatsApp group chats by focusing on task-aware summaries that highlight deadlines, action items, and contributions. Our approach adapts [base paper method] to WhatsApp-style chats using publicly available datasets (SAMSum, DialogSum) and small-scale WhatsApp exports.”

5. Objectives

Summarize WhatsApp group chats into concise overviews.

Extract tasks, decisions, and deadlines.

Provide chat-based reminders.

Evaluate performance on standard datasets (SAMSum, DialogSum) + WhatsApp case study.

6. Methodology (High-Level Plan)

Dataset: Start with SAMSum, extend with small WhatsApp exports.

Model: Fine-tune summarization model (BART/T5) or apply MRDS (LLM augmentation).

Extension: Add task/decision extraction → convert into bullet points.

Integration: Deploy prototype that can send summaries back into WhatsApp (using Twilio or yowsup API).

7. Feasibility

Datasets are openly available.

Pre-trained models (BART/T5/PEGASUS) ready on HuggingFace.

Fine-tuning is possible on lab GPUs in 1–2 days.

Timeline: Half-semester → feasible scope.

8. Expected Outcomes

A WhatsApp group chat assistant (“Jarvis”) that:

Summarizes daily chats.

Extracts tasks/deadlines.

Provides reminders inside WhatsApp.

Evaluation: ROUGE/BERTScore on SAMSum + human evaluation on WhatsApp.

9. Timeline (Gantt chart style if possible)

Week 1–2: Literature Review & Dataset setup

Week 3–4: Model fine-tuning / LLM prompting

Week 5: Add task extraction module

Week 6: WhatsApp integration prototype

Week 7: Testing & Evaluation

Week 8: Report & Presentation

10. Conclusion

Project bridges NLP + Social Computing.

Novelty: Task-aware summarization for WhatsApp (team setting).

Feasible within semester, aligns with NLP + SC project guidelines

# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Goal: Build, tune, and evaluate a Logistic Regression model to predict Airbnb review scores 
# based on neighborhood, listing features, and textual reviews.
#
# Tasks:
# 1. Load and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical data, scale features).
# 2. Split data into train/test sets.
# 3. Use TF-IDF vectorization for textual review data and combine it with structured features.
# 4. Train a Logistic Regression model with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
# 5. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
# 6. Save the trained model using joblib.
#
# Use scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
# Dataset: Use Airbnb listing dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or Inside Airbnb)
# Columns may include: 'neighbourhood', 'price', 'room_type', 'number_of_reviews', 'review_scores_rating', 'comments'

14/10/25, 00:10 - Sohil Nigga (Drug Dealer Who Can't Eat Drugs): Project Report: Neighborhood and Price Prediction for Albany Airbnb Listings
Author: [SOHIL N S and SUMIT SANTOSH NAIR]

 Date: October 14, 2025

Abstract
This project explores the predictability of Airbnb listing characteristics in Albany, NY, using a dataset from "Inside Airbnb." We developed two machine learning models to address distinct classification tasks: predicting a listing's neighborhood and predicting whether its price is above or below the local median. The methodology involved extensive feature engineering, including TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams for text data and one-hot encoding for structured data. A Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) was trained for both tasks, with hyperparameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV. The neighborhood prediction model achieved high performance, with 86.7% accuracy and 90.5% precision, indicating that textual descriptions contain strong geographic signals. The price prediction model, however, showed clear signs of overfitting, performing well on the development set but achieving only 66.7% accuracy on the test set. This report details our data processing pipeline, feature engineering strategy, modeling results, and provides a discussion on model performance and future work, including strategies to mitigate overfitting.

1. Introduction
The online rental marketplace, exemplified by platforms like Airbnb, has become a significant component of the hospitality industry. The vast amount of data generated by these platforms presents an opportunity to model and understand the factors that define a listing's market position and geographic identity.

This project focuses on the Airbnb market in Albany, New York. Our primary goal is to determine the extent to which machine learning models can classify listings based on publicly available data. We address two specific research questions:

Neighborhood Prediction: Can a listing's neighborhood be accurately predicted using the contents of its description and its structured features (e.g., room type, amenities)? A successful model would highlight the unique linguistic and feature-based signatures of different neighborhoods.

Price Range Prediction: Can we predict whether a listing's price is above or below the median price for the area? This binary classification task is a proxy for understanding what features are associated with higher-value properties.

This report outlines our methodology, from data preparation and feature engineering to model training and evaluation. We present a detailed analysis of the results for both models and conclude with a discussion of our findings and potential avenues for future research.

2. Methodology
Our approach involved a multi-stage pipeline designed to transform raw listing data into a format suitable for machine learning and to train robust classification models.

2.1. Data
The dataset was sourced from the "Inside Airbnb" project, providing a comprehensive snapshot of listings in Albany. Key fields utilized in this study included:

Textual Data: summary, space, description, neighborhood_overview, transit, etc.

Categorical Data: property_type, room_type, cancellation_policy.

Numerical Data: price, bedrooms, bathrooms, accommodates, cleaning_fee.

2.2. Feature Engineering
To capture the varied information within the dataset, we engineered three distinct sets of features, which were later combined.

TF-IDF Features: The textual data from all relevant fields was concatenated. We used TfidfVectorizer to convert this text into a numerical format. Key parameters included:

N-grams: ngram_range=(1, 2) was used to capture both individual words and two-word phrases, which can provide more context (e.g., "downtown albany").

Preprocessing: A custom analyzer was used to perform stemming, remove stop words, and filter out neighborhood names to prevent data leakage.

Feature Pruning: We set max_features=2000 and min_df=3 to keep the feature space manageable and remove very rare terms.

Handpicked Text Features: We computed sentiment scores (polarity, subjectivity) and word/character counts from the descriptions.

Structured Features: Categorical features were one-hot encoded, and numerical features were used directly.

2.3. Modeling Pipeline
The modeling process was standardized for both prediction tasks:

Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training (80%), development (10%), and testing (10%) sets using a stratified approach to maintain class distribution.

Feature Scaling: All combined features were scaled using MaxAbsScaler, which is essential for the performance of SVMs and is well-suited for sparse matrices.

Feature Selection: We employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most informative features for each model.

Model Selection: A Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) was chosen due to its high efficiency with high-dimensional, sparse data common in text classification. class_weight="balanced" was used to handle any class imbalance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV with 3-fold stratified cross-validation was used to find the optimal regularization hyperparameter C for the SVM.

3. Results
The trained models were evaluated on the held-out test set. The results for each task are presented below.

3.1. Neighborhood Prediction Model
This model demonstrated high predictive power, successfully identifying the correct neighborhood for the vast majority of listings.

Test Accuracy: 86.7%

Test Precision: 90.5%

Test F1-Score: 87.0%

Best C Hyperparameter: 1000

The high precision indicates that when the model predicted a certain neighborhood, it was very likely to be correct.

3.2. Price Prediction Model
The price prediction model showed a significant discrepancy between its performance on the development and test sets, a clear indicator of overfitting.

Development Accuracy: 85.7%

Test Accuracy: 66.7%

Test Precision: 67.3%

Test F1-Score: 66.7%

Best C Hyperparameter: 1000

The model learned patterns specific to the training/development data that did not generalize to the unseen test data.

4. Discussion
The results provide valuable insights into the Albany Airbnb market and our modeling approach.

The outstanding performance of the neighborhood prediction model confirms that neighborhoods in Albany have distinct "linguistic fingerprints." Phrases related to local landmarks, street names, and ambiance captured by the TF-IDF and n-gram features are powerful predictors of location.

In contrast, the price prediction model suffered from overfitting. The selection of a very large C value (1000) by GridSearchCV indicates that the model was too complex. A large C reduces the strength of regularization, encouraging the model to fit the training data as closely as possible, including its noise. This resulted in a model that memorized the training set rather than learning generalizable patterns about what makes a listing expensive.

5. Conclusion and Future Work
This project successfully developed a high-accuracy model for predicting Airbnb neighborhoods in Albany, demonstrating the value of text-based features. We also identified a clear case of overfitting in our price prediction model, which provides a critical learning for future iterations.

Based on these findings, we recommend the following next steps:

Address Overfitting in Price Model: The most critical next step is to retrain the price model with stronger regularization. This can be achieved by providing GridSearchCV with a range of smaller C values (e.g., [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]), forcing it to choose a simpler, more generalizable model.

Feature Importance Analysis: For the successful neighborhood model, an analysis of feature importance should be conducted to identify which specific words and phrases are the strongest indicators for each neighborhood.

To avoid unexpected runtime failures, or future build failures, try to migrate this app to the V2 embedding.
Take a look at the docs for migrating an app:
